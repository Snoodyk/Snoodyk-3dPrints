# SNOODYK 3D PRINTS
- __Welcome to my project__
Hello, Welcome to my code institute project for my bootcamp course. The site is a simple blog and gallery with comment CRUD funcionality. I was going to add more CRUD to gallery but could not make it work in time. 



- __The Home page__ 

  - Home page brings you into the blogs so you can read about 3d printing. The header has the gallery and about page.

- __Gallery__

  - Gallery which will add CRUD functionality to in future. Did not have enough time to figure out this time around.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - Minor errors in validator with code but when code removed would destroy website. Left code in for posible future fixs. [W3C validator](https://res.cloudinary.com/djvqvtu86/image/upload/v1711197981/readme/validation_h4bfos.png)


### Fixed Bugs
- Had an error with URL not connecting to the right URL when the header buttons where use on pages other then the index page.
![URL Error](https://res.cloudinary.com/djvqvtu86/image/upload/v1711037420/readme/URL_Bug_qphlrj.png)
- Bug took awhile to fix but found the issue with the code 
![URL Bug Found](https://res.cloudinary.com/djvqvtu86/image/upload/v1711037668/readme/missing_slash_fumbcc.png)
- Issue was caused by missing a / at the start of href="/gallery"


### Unfixed Bugs

- When deleting comment for CRUD functionality it will sometimes fail. Will need to go back a page and press delete button again. ![Delete bug](https://res.cloudinary.com/djvqvtu86/image/upload/v1711197574/readme/delete_error_pziddw.png)
- When pressed error button it might not work the first time. Clicking away from error button and back to it should make error button work.
